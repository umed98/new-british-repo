                        Model United Nations (MUN) is an interactive educational simulation where students step into the roles of UN delegates, representing different nations in discussions on pressing global issues. These include international security, human rights, climate change, economic policies, and more.
 MUN provides a platform for young minds to engage in diplomacy, negotiation, and debate, mirroring real-world international relations. Participants research their assigned countries' positions, draft resolutions, and collaborate to find viable solutions to global challenges. Through these conferences, students develop crucial skills such as public speaking, critical thinking, leadership, and problem-solving.
 Beyond academics, MUN fosters cultural awareness, teamwork, and confidence, preparing students to be informed global citizens. It is a transformative experience that empowers the youth to think critically about world affairs and contribute meaningfully to society
