A silent revolution in education came in Kanpur when the Allenhouse Group of Schools established its first school in the city's heart.

                        <p class="text-[16px] sm:text-left  text-gray-600 mt-5">
                        The first Allenhouse came up in 2006 and swiftly earned an excellent reputation for delivering high-quality schooling combining academic rigour and co-curricular and sports education. Its state-of-art infrastructure, safe and secure environment and global collaborations with International programs like International Award for Young People, Cambridge English Language Assessment, and British Council-International Award were a refreshing change from the monotonous curriculum of conventional schools. Thus Allenhouse Khalasi line was soon ranked among the top 5 schools in Kanpur.
